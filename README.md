👋 Hi, I’m @BlessingEbele

As a Backend Developer and Chinese–English Translator, I’m passionate about building digital solutions that make systems work — and messages connect.
I combine Python, Django, and API development expertise with a deep understanding of language, culture, and human-centered design to create tools that don’t just function, but serve people.

Over time, I’ve developed strong skills in:
🔹 Backend development: Python, Django, RESTful APIs, MySQL, and database architecture.
🔹 Software engineering principles: clean code, testing, version control (Git), and security best practices.
🔹 Cross-cultural communication: professional Chinese–English translation and localization for tech, education, and healthcare projects.
🔹 Creative communication: crafting impact-driven content through my personal brand, Blessing’s Legacy Diaries.

My goal is to bridge technology and language — helping purpose-driven organizations, startups, and global teams deliver scalable, inclusive solutions that reach the people who need them most.

If you’re looking for someone who can translate complex technical problems into elegant, human-centered solutions, or make your product accessible to both English and Chinese-speaking audiences, let’s connect.
